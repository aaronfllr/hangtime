This is a simple hangboard app built around the dimensions of the Tension Block.
Other configurations can easily be added by manipulating the
front-end/src/components/NewHangForm.js file in the hold section. Model may need
to be up updated if length exceeds maximum.
This app is useful for keeping up with quick hangs in between meetings while
working from home.
To get started ensure that all of the requirements are met in the requirements.txt file.
You may have to install bootstrap with; install bootstrap #npm install bootstrap reactstrap axios --save
This app is maintained and updated by Aaron Fuller.
